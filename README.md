# rPandas: The Power of Pandas, The Simplicity of R

[![R-CMD-check](https://github.com/akshat09867/rPandas/actions/workflows/R-CMD-check.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/akshat09867/rPandas/actions/workflows/R-CMD-check.yaml)
**rPandas** bridges the gap between R and Python. It allows R users to manipulate data using familiar, `dplyr`-style syntax while leveraging the speed and efficiency of the Python `pandas` library in the background.



## Why use rPandas?

* **Best of Both Worlds:** Write code in R, but execute it in Python.
* **Zero Python Knowledge Required:** You don't need to know Python syntax to use it. rPandas handles the translation for you.
* **Learning Tool:** Curious how your R code translates to Python? Every function has a `return.as = "code"` argument that shows you the exact Pandas code being generated.
* **Seamless Integration:** Works with R data frames and integrates easily into your existing workflows using the pipe (`%>%` or `|>`).
